# 🚀 **Automated Testing Project with Playwright and TypeScript**

## 📋 **Overview**

The tests are written in **TypeScript** using **Playwright** for testing across different browsers.

## 🌟 **Features**

- **🔄 Automated Pipeline**:  
  I've set up a pipeline using **GitHub Actions**. The tests run automatically whenever there’s a new push or pull request to the main branches, ensuring that all changes are tested.

- **📊 Allure Report**:  
  The project includes **Allure Report** for generating detailed and easy-to-read test reports.

- **📲 Telegram Notifications**:  
  The project is connected to **Telegram** to send notifications about the test results. You’ll get updates on both successful and failed tests.

## ⚙️ **Current Setup**

- **🔍 Basic Test Example**:  
  Right now, the project has one test. This serves as a basic setup to demonstrate how the pipeline, reporting, and notifications work.

- **🌱 Future Expansion**:  
  This is just the beginning. I plan to add more tests and features to this project over time, making it more comprehensive.
